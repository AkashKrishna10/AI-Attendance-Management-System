# Face Recognition Attendance System
** Overview
This project implements a face recognition system using Python and OpenCV, capable of recognizing and logging attendance based on known faces captured through a webcam.

The system utilizes the face_recognition library for face detection and recognition. It continuously captures frames from a webcam, detects faces, compares them with pre-defined known faces, and logs attendance in a CSV file.

** Features
Real-time face detection and recognition.
Attendance logging with date and time stamp.
Simple GUI for displaying live video feed with recognized faces.
** Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2) library
face_recognition library (Install using pip install face_recognition)
numpy library (for array operations)
datetime module (for timestamping)
